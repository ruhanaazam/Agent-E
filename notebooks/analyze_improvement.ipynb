Each failure case was annotated by a real human with the reason for the web-navigator's failure. Help me analyze the failure cases. Please categorize the top-5 failure cases and give me examples of each. Think deeply about why each of these cases may occur and what causes each error type. Below is a csv file containing failure cases only. There are three columns: 1) start_url, which is the website the task was performed on 2) the intent, this is the task that the agent was given to perform and 3) the reason, this is the annotators' explaination for why the task failed: {data}\""

Warnings were issued in four Canadian provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, with officials warning of 'dangerously hot and humid conditions.' This extreme heat, described as the region's first significant heatwave of the season, was brought on by a 'heat dome' phenomenon. In the United States, temperatures were expected to top 100F (38C) on Wednesday or Thursday, with Chicago setting a new daily record for June 17, surpassing the all-time high of 96F recorded in 1957. Major cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Washington were also affected. The Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast were expected to be the worst-affected areas, with record-breaking temperatures possible. Additionally, a wildfire north of Los Angeles, California, forced evacuations, and preparations were underway for the first tropical storm of the season, Alberto, which could impact the Gulf Coast, southern Mexico, and parts of Central America. Parts of Montana experienced rare June snow due to an NWS winter storm warning.</td>\n",

       "31  The severe weather, characterized by excessive heat warnings, occurred in the United States and Canada. More than 70 million Americans, about one in five of the population, were living under heat alerts due to soaring temperatures. Warnings were issued in four Canadian provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, with officials warning of 'dangerously hot and humid conditions.' This extreme heat, described as the region's first significant heatwave of the season, was brought on by a 'heat dome' phenomenon. In the United States, temperatures were expected to top 100F (38C) on Wednesday or Thursday, with Chicago setting a new daily record for June 17, surpassing the all-time high of 96F recorded in 1957. Major cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Washington were also affected. The Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast were expected to be the worst-affected areas, with record-breaking temperatures possible. Additionally, a wildfire north of Los Angeles, California, forced evacuations, and preparations were underway for the first tropical storm of the season, Alberto, which could impact the Gulf Coast, southern Mexico, and parts of Central America. Parts of Montana experienced rare June snow due to an NWS winter storm warning.  \n",

An example provided is: \"This car is more expensive than my last one.\"\\n\\n- **Superlative adjectives** are used to describe one person or thing as having more of a quality than all other people or things in a group. An example given is: \"Joe used to be the slowest runner in the class.\"\\n\\nThese rules help articulate differences in quality among people or things by comparing them directly or by highlighting an extreme quality in comparison to a group.  \n",
